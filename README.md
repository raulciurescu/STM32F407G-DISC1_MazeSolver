# STM32F407G-DISC1_MazeSolver
This repository contains a Maze Solver project for the STM32F407G-DISC1 development board. The project demonstrates how to program the STM32F407G-DISC1 to solve a maze autonomously. It is a perfect project to apply your embedded systems skills in a fun and practical way.

Project Overview
The Maze Solver is designed to navigate through a maze using the STM32F407G-DISC1 board. It combines various concepts from embedded systems programming and hardware control, such as:

Sensor Integration (e.g., distance sensors)
Motor Control for navigating through the maze.
Pathfinding Algorithm Implementation (e.g., left-hand rule or wall-following algorithms).
What's Inside
This repository includes:

The complete project folder for popular IDEs like Keil or STM32CubeIDE.
Source code to implement and customize the maze-solving algorithm.
Documentation and comments within the code to help you understand each part of the project.
Why This Project?
This Maze Solver project is an exciting next step after working with basic STM32F407G-DISC1 concepts. It not only solidifies your knowledge of GPIO and sensor integration but also introduces real-world problem-solving using microcontrollers. You'll gain hands-on experience with:

Algorithm design for embedded systems.
Hardware-software integration to solve a practical problem.
